# Overview. How to play?
A [hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) made in Python. In this game, we have to figure out a word by guessing one letter at a time. However, with each error, the man will get one step closer to his perish. The goal is to successfully guess the word before the man gets hanged. In order to play this game you simply need to download the repository to your pc and run hangman.py.
There is an included wordlist.txt file ([source](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html)) that contains over 58,000 English words. You can customize your game further by adding new words onto the included wordlist.txt file.

# Requirements
Python v3.10.1
